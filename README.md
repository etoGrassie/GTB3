# GTB3
The 3rd version of GTB, and remember that GTB2 is no longer available. 

## Get Started

### What is this?
GTB is a personal tool box, it is for school and class. 
GTB has these features (may update in later versions):
- Random from numbers or objects
- Browser automations and control
- Fast and multiple files control
- More features is coming... *Star this project to receive the latest update!*

### How do I use it?
GTB has a *special * command system, the developer named it **Tasking Command**

**Tasking Command** starts with **gtb** *(Yeah you know, you're so lucky to meet this version. In GTB 2. * it needs starts with **TSK**)*
A normal task command is like this:
````text
gtb prt 'Hello, World';
````
Or if you like full-spelling more, you can type like this:
````text
gtb print 'Hello, World';
````
Their outputs are both like:
> Hello, World

Ok, I think now you know Tasking Command a little. If you want to check out more functions and features, please go to this file:
